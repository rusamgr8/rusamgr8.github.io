**Perfecting 24** is all about daily practice to make all the 24 hours of a day totally perfect.

This goes by analyzing minute by minute of an hour.

Follow the things planned for that hour.

Decide the action item for that hour, keep **FOCUSING** on that, until it becomes routine.

Then move on to another hour.

Parallel practice in a day is fine, but focus should not diminish.

Let's begin...

For **perfecting all 24 hours**, we must start with small slots of hours. We must __deconstruct__ whole day into slots. Along with that, we must plan out total amount of time we want to invest for particular activity.

For example, one of my friend wants to invest 3 hours of his day for studying. So what he must do is, he should book 3 hours of his day for studying purpose. Now, the first step of deconstruction comes into picture. He should deconstruct 3 hours into 3 slots of an hour ( period of a slot is flexible). But starting directly with 1 hour is difficult for him. So he further deconstructs that slot and start with 20 minutes per slot (number of slots remains same). Total study time is now 60 minutes a day.

Remember, small daily improvements over time leads to stunning results.

Once he got comfortable with 20 minutes a slot technique he increased slot time to 25 minutes. This way now he is able to study for 75 minutes a day. Let's take a step back. If he would have directly started with 3 hours a day that is 180 minutes for studying, he could have given up in few days. Again, when he got comfortable with 25 minutes a slot, he raised his bar to 30 minutes. This gave him 90 minutes in total to spend on his studies. Likewise, he reached to 60 minutes a slot and 3 such slots, so now my friend is able to give complete 180 minutes for his studies. This way he has perfected his 3 hours out of 24 hours.

##  _Remember, every minute counts._

### ALL THE BEST.
