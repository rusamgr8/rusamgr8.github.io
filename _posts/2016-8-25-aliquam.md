**Perfecting 24** is all about daily practice to make all the 24 hours of a day totally perfect.

This goes by analyzing minute by minute of an hour.

Follow the things planned for that hour.

Decide the action item for that hour, keep **FOCUSING** on that, until it becomes routine.

Then move on to another hour.

Parallel practice in a day is fine, but focus should not diminish.

##  _Remember, every minute counts._

### ALL THE BEST.
